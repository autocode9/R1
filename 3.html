<p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the <strong>infraorder Simiiformes</strong>, also known as the simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the <a href="https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/APE" target="_blank" title="About Ape"><u>apes</u></a>,  
thus monkeys (in that sense) constitute an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard to their scope. 
Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Animal population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of bird, mammal and reptile species.
